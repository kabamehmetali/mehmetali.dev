          Since the moment humanity produced its first intellectual creation, it has gone
          through numerous historical stages. We have established different societies,
          reached various levels of civilization, and throughout these processes, our
          physical and intellectual evolution has continued. From the Stone Age to the
          Agricultural Revolution, and then to the Industrial Revolution, these historical
          transformations have fundamentally changed how societies work and live. For instance,
          in agrarian societies, the need for more labor led families to have many children.
          However, with the Machine Age in the 20th century, agricultural activities became
          largely mechanized, reducing the need for human labor.
        </p>

          style="
            font-family: 'Varela Round', sans-serif;
            font-size: 1.2rem;

            margin-bottom: 20px;
          "

          Thanks to this mechanization, the workforce that was once heavily employed in
          agriculture began to shift toward other fields, using machines that ranged from
          simple elevators to complex technologies. This shift enabled the construction of
          massive structures and achievements in areas like engineering and architecture.
          Today, in the 21st century, automating machines and equipping them with artificial
          intelligence have become more critical than ever. The millions of years of evolution
          in living organisms seem to parallel the gradual development of machinery and software
          technology.

          Just as past revolutions dramatically altered the course of human history, I believe
          the era of artificial intelligence will also lead to significant changes in our future.
          Every innovation that reduces physical labor ultimately highlights our intellectual
          capabilities. Therefore, I consider every investment in software to be immensely
          valuable for future social and technological progress. Software and artificial
          intelligence will not only transform the business or industrial sectors but also
          revolutionize every aspect of daily life, opening the doors to an entirely new era.
